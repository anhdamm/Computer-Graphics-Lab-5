## Texture Mapping

### Write an OpenGL program to texture a simple planar polygon using a digital texture image file

#### I create an OpenGL program to texture a rectangle and use 3 different texture targa images file.
- Add lighting (ambient and diffuse to the viewport)
- Add keyboard to control among texture files:
  - 'a': choose marble.tga texture file
  - 'b': choose fish.tga texture file
  - 'c': choose color.tga texture file
- Add a menu to choose different type of textures:
  - Nearest
  - Linear
  - Clamp
  - No texture
  
- I use Blending Activity class as reference for read tga file
